Build a web app called "PromptVault" - a prompt management tool where users can save, organize, and quickly copy their AI prompts.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Supabase for database and authentication
- TypeScript

## Core Features

### Authentication
- Sign up with email/password
- Login/logout
- Protected routes (redirect to login if not authenticated)

### Database Schema

USERS (handled by Supabase Auth)

FOLDERS table:
- id (uuid, primary key, default uuid_generate_v4())
- user_id (uuid, references auth.users)
- name (text)
- sort_order (integer, default 0)
- created_at (timestamp, default now())

PROMPTS table:
- id (uuid, primary key, default uuid_generate_v4())
- user_id (uuid, references auth.users)
- folder_id (uuid, references folders, nullable)
- title (text)
- content (text)
- platform (text, nullable) - e.g., "ChatGPT", "Claude", "Midjourney"
- notes (text, nullable)
- usage_count (integer, default 0)
- created_at (timestamp, default now())
- updated_at (timestamp, default now())

TAGS table:
- id (uuid, primary key, default uuid_generate_v4())
- user_id (uuid, references auth.users)
- name (text)

PROMPT_TAGS junction table:
- prompt_id (uuid, references prompts)
- tag_id (uuid, references tags)
- primary key (prompt_id, tag_id)

### UI Layout

Three-column layout:
1. LEFT SIDEBAR (fixed, 250px wide):
   - App logo "PromptVault" at top
   - Search input
   - "All Prompts" nav link
   - "Unsorted" nav link  
   - "FOLDERS" section header with + button to add folder
   - List of folders (clickable to filter prompts)
   - "TAGS" section header
   - List of tags with count badges (clickable to filter)
   - User avatar and logout at bottom

2. MIDDLE SECTION (flexible width):
   - Header with current view name (e.g., "All Prompts" or folder name)
   - "New Prompt" button in header
   - Sort dropdown (Recent, A-Z, Most Used)
   - List of prompt cards, each showing:
     - Title
     - Tags as small pills/badges
     - "Copy" button on the right
     - Timestamp (e.g., "2 hours ago")
   - Clicking a prompt card opens it in the right panel

3. RIGHT PANEL (400px wide, slides in when prompt selected):
   - Close X button
   - Title input field
   - Content textarea (large, this is the main prompt text)
   - Helper text: "You can use variables like {{variable}}. You'll fill them in when you copy."
   - Platform dropdown (ChatGPT, Claude, Midjourney, Other)
   - Folder dropdown
   - Tags input (autocomplete, can add multiple)
   - Notes textarea
   - "Save" button (green)
   - "Save & Copy" button (secondary)
   - Small text showing "Saved [date]"

### Key Functionality

1. COPY WITH VARIABLES:
   - When user clicks "Copy" button on a prompt
   - Check if content contains {{variableName}} patterns
   - If yes: show a modal asking user to fill in each variable value
   - Replace variables with user input
   - Copy final text to clipboard
   - Show toast "Copied to clipboard!"
   - Increment usage_count for that prompt

2. SEARCH:
   - Real-time search as user types
   - Search through prompt titles and content
   - Debounce input (300ms)

3. FILTERING:
   - Click folder in sidebar → show only prompts in that folder
   - Click tag in sidebar → show only prompts with that tag
   - "All Prompts" shows everything
   - "Unsorted" shows prompts with no folder

4. CRUD OPERATIONS:
   - Create new prompt (opens empty right panel)
   - Edit prompt (click existing prompt)
   - Delete prompt (button in editor, with confirmation)
   - Create/rename/delete folders
   - Auto-save or save on button click

### Styling Guidelines
- Clean, minimal design
- White/light gray background
- Primary accent color: purple (#7C3AED)
- Cards have subtle shadows and rounded corners
- Smooth transitions when panels open/close
- Toast notifications for actions (copied, saved, deleted)

### Nice to Have (if time permits)
- Drag and drop to reorder prompts or move to folders
- Favorite/star prompts
- Dark mode toggle
- Export prompts as JSON
- Import prompts from JSON

## Initial Seed Data
After user signs up, create these default folders:
- Marketing
- Sales
- Customer Support

And create 3 sample prompts so the app doesn't look empty:

1. Title: "Blog Post Outline"
   Content: "Create a detailed outline for a blog post about {{topic}}. Include an engaging introduction, 5 main sections with subpoints, and a conclusion with a call to action."
   Folder: Marketing
   Tags: content, blog

2. Title: "Cold Email Sequence"
   Content: "Write a 3-email cold outreach sequence for {{company}} targeting {{audience}}. Email 1 should introduce the problem, Email 2 should present the solution, Email 3 should create urgency."
   Folder: Sales
   Tags: email, outreach

3. Title: "Customer Complaint Response"
   Content: "You are a customer support agent for {{company}}. Write a professional and empathetic response to a customer who is upset about {{issue}}. Acknowledge their frustration, apologize, and offer a concrete solution."
   Folder: Customer Support
   Tags: support, response

## Environment Variables Needed
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

Please set up Supabase with the schema above and make sure Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled so users can only see their own data.
